InstaVine
=========

Advanced DSP Design Lab (EE586L) project implemented on TI-Da Vinci Video Processing Board (DM6437) under Prof.Panayiotis Georgiou

The Instagram app went viral soon after its launch. It became so popular that Facebook decided to take over it. 
The motivation for this project is to take the features of Instagram one step ahead and create a real-time video Instagram. 
The user will be able to choose from a given set of filters that can be applied to the video that is being captured by the camera in real-time. 
So it is a fusion of the popular Image Processing App ‘Instagram®’ and the video app ‘Vine®’ and hence, we decided to call it ‘InstaVine’.

The system will consist of the following parts:
1. Camera for capturing the video
2. Video Processing DSP board
	*The DIP switches on the board will be used for choosing the filter to be applied.
	*The DSP chip will perform the necessary processing to apply the filter to each frame of the video at appropriate FPS
3. Monitor for displaying the real-time video with the filter applied. 
The advantage of this project over the already existing apps is that the effect of the filter can be seen as the video is being captured. 
In the existing apps, the filters are applied on captured and stored images or videos. 
A possible application of this project can be to integrate these features into digital cameras. 
This will allow the user to instantly capture videos with filters already applied to them.
